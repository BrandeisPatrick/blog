You are working in a checkout of sphinx-doc/sphinx at commit dd1615c59dc6.
The project's virtualenv (.venv) is installed (editable) and already activated:
`python` and `pytest` on PATH are the project's own.

Below is a real GitHub issue for this repository. Fix it.

Rules:
- Modify source code only. Do NOT modify any test files.
- Work only from this checkout. Do NOT download, install or consult any other copy
  or later version of this project (no pip/curl/git fetches of upstream code), and
  do not read files outside this directory apart from your own scratch files.
- Verify your fix by running relevant tests before finishing.
- When done, summarize the root cause and your change.

<issue>
autodoc inherited-members won't work for inherited attributes (data members).
autodoc searches for a cached docstring using (namespace, attrname) as search-key, but doesn't check for baseclass-namespace.
